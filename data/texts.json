	"events": {
		"home1": "I wake up at home. The silence is first thing that feels wrong. No breakfast sounds. No cartoons. No laughter. Just the groan of the water heater and the hum of the refrigerator.\n\n'Hey, kiddo?'\n\nNo answer. Down the hall her door sits open, revealing an unmade bed and an untouched backpack. The house is too still.",
		"home2": "Inside my house the air tastes stale, thick with absence, like a breath held too long. I tell myself she just forgot to leave a note. I almost believe it. Almost. The house disagrees, its silence screaming what I won't admit: she's been gone longer than I think.",
		"dresser1": "On the table I find my trusty transit pass. But why is it on a stack of takeout menus? I don't remember putting it there. I take it, trying not to think too hard about it. Then pause - there's something else.\n\nA letter. Wax-sealed. Torn edges. Words cut from magazines:\n\n'WE HAVE YOUR DAUGHTER.\nSHE WAS CHOSEN FOR THIS FATE.\nGO FOLLOW THE TIDE.'\n\nIt smells like the ocean. And something rotten.",
		"hall": "The hall closet yields a collapsible metal detector... It's odd, but potentially useful. I stash it in my bag, wondering when or why I even bought this.",
		"hall2": "Her room remains frozen—the same unmade bed, the same forgotten backpack. No clues about where she's gone.",
		"hatch": "A square hatch of wood graces the ceiling. How'd I forget about the attic? The pull-down ladder's been broken since childhood. Getting up there won't be easy.",
		"street": "I peer out my front window. A shadow by the telephone pole stands too tall, too still. My DVR security camera system would probably show grainy evidence, if I could get online to check it... but I haven't had internet for months.",
		"attic": "I place down the stepladder and use it to boost myself to the attic hatch, pulling myself up and through. I'm not sure how long it's been since I've been in here. Forever ago.",
		"get-robe": "The drawer reveals a blood-red robe with gold trim, nestled between mothballs. Why did Grandpa own this ceremonial-looking thing? The fabric smells of camphor and something earthier, but it might prove useful.",
		"windowgaze": "The window's grime distorts the world like a funhouse mirror. Vines slither through cracks, their stems unnaturally thick and glistening like oil-slicked flesh.",
		"get-rope": "Rope coils in heaps—some strands knotted into crude symbols. A few twitch when the wind rattles the pane. I gather them quickly, my skin prickling as the knots brush my palms.",
		"nopass": "The turnstile light blares red. My transit pass is still at home.",
		"transit": "The turnstile clicks open like a tongue. The station hums with bored commuters. A child's laugh is drowned out by crackling static from the speakers. 'Next train: Beach Line. Last departure today.' The clerk nods—like he's seen this play out before.",
		"library": "The air stinks of ozone and rotting paper. The librarian's fingers tap like a metronome.\n\n'Card?' she drones, nasally.\n\nWhen I shake my head, she slides a signup form across the desk. A few minutes later, I have a new card in hand.\n\n'Terminal three. One hour.'\n\nHer tone suggests books aren't why people come here anymore.",
		"library2": "The monitor glows sickly. Social media? Blocked. News? Blocked. But local archives load: weather news, tide charts, arrest reports, notices about missing pets near the shore. The clock above the terminal ticks louder than it should.",
		"left-library": "Fluorescents buzz weakly like dying flies as I step outside.\n\nAcross the square, a gargoyle on the library's facade watches me a beat too long. Its stone eyes seem to track my movement.",
		"stacks": "Looking through old microfiche newspapers isn't my idea of fun, but what else can I do? I scan quickly for headlines about disappearances in town.\n\nHere's one. Apparently the '86 chemical spill was a cover-up for cult activity, and hostages were rescued. A faded photo shows the sheriff padlocking that blue shack on the beach.\n\nSomehow scribbled in the margin: '6-20-25, high tide on the solstice.' The numbers itch at my brain. Is it a date?",
		"stacks2": "I go over what I've found. In old microfiche articles, there are headlines about local disappearances.\n\nIn '86, a cult called 'The Tide' was found responsible for numerous abductions. Faded photos relate the shack on the beach to this cult.\n\nThere are also numbers scrawled in the margins that seem important somehow: '6-20-25'.",
		"detective2": "The detective's desk is a graveyard of files.\n\nThe detective himself, gone. But I'm here by invite. I get myself a coffee.",
		"police-computer": "The password screen shows his wallpaper—the detective and a woman holding up their wedding rings. He's actually smiling in the photo. The date in the corner is from three weeks ago.",
		"evidence": "A red vinyl chair stands out against the drab walls. Case labels whisper: 'Missing. Arson. Cult Activity?' Box #17 rustles faintly—like fingernails on cardboard. I step back.",
		"paperwork": "A detailed site-plan reveals a network of tunnels beneath the island mansion. The annotations suggest easy access if I approach from the north side. Someone drew a red circle around the property.",
		"window": "I tilt the blinds open further. Through wire-reinforced glass, the precinct buzzes with muted activity. I notice the assistant watching me, and I close the shutters again.",
		"beach": "The shack shouldn't still be standing. Its blue planks look freshly painted despite decades of salt wind. The padlock gleams like new.\n\nA weathered notice flaps:\n'NO TRESPASSING BY ORDER OF THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE'\n\nThe rest is worn into illegibility.",
		"dagger": "The metal detector shrieks after I wave it around here a few times. Buried under a foot of sand: a ritual knife with a serrated edge. I nearly slice my finger digging it up.",
		"sand": "Hot grit slips through my fingers. Each handful feels heavier than it should. There's probably nothing here. Probably.",
		"sky": "The clouds hang like damp gauze—translucent and stubborn. They don’t move so much as peel, slow and grudging, as if the sky can’t decide whether to heal or scar. The sun bleeds through in patches, hot and uneven, like a fever pressing against glass.",
		"shack": "The blue shack from the articles. My only real lead. The rusty old padlock stares back, daring me to try its combination.",
		"door": "Heavy-duty combination lock. The dials turn stiffly but aren't frozen. Someone's been here recently enough to keep it from rusting shut.",
		"dog": "A massive dog blocks the path—muscle and matted fur. Its growl vibrates in my chest. Every childhood fear of dark basements and bad dogs surges up. Run. Now.",
		"pet-dog": "Good doggo! The beast's tail wags as I scratch behind its ears. A wet tongue drags across my wrist.\n\n[Sanity Restored!]",
		"shack1": "This is the same rusty old padlock I've seen in the photos. I try the numbers I saw earlier, 6-20-25, and the lock resists a moment before yielding. The door groans on its rusty hinges. The mildew smell hits first, then the sheer size of the interior. The building feels different now, as if this stopped being a shack the moment I crossed the threshold.",
		"shack2": "The lock explodes and metal flies. My hands still shaking from the vibration of the shot, I push against the door and it groans on its rusty hinges. The mildew smell hits first, then the sheer size of the interior. The building feels different now, as if this stopped being a shack the moment I crossed the threshold.",
		"shack3": "Tide charts cover the walls, their symbols playing tricks on my eyes. The floorboards warp unnaturally into stone. The air hums—not with wind, but voices. Chanting. Or maybe that's just the blood roaring in my ears.",
		"get-ladder": "I pick up the old metal stepladder from the corner, and carry it with me.",
		"shack-desk": "The drawer reveals a map—recruitment targets circled in red ink. The hilltop mansion dominates the center, while outward arrows seem to indicate this is a sort of headquarters.\n\nRecent coffee stains suggest this is still an active plan.",
		"shack-drawers": "Rope loops tangle in the drawer. Not a single length but dozens of pre-made hoops and nooses. They stack neatly despite their apparent grim purpose.",
		"shack-empty": "The drawers are mysteriously empty. Not counting the cobwebs...",
		"mansion": "A robed figure materializes from the shadows, pressing a flyer into my palm. His fingers stretch too long, his nails ridged with old blood. 'The Tide doesn't need you yet,' he rasps. Behind him, the mansion's windows pulse—not with light, but with movement.",
		"cultist": "The robed figure looms closer. My skin crawls with the certainty that his hood shadows no human face. Time to go.",
		"cultist-scared": "The robed figure looms closer. I wave my new gun in his face and he scampers off back into the mansion...",
		"balcony": "The balcony hangs just beyond reach. No matter how I jump, my fingers scrape empty air.",
		"tunnels": "I spend what feels like hours stumbling through lightless passages. My hands brush damp stone until finally—a door. The wood thrums under my touch.",
		"has-rope": "The rope snakes around the balcony post. One tug to test it, then I haul myself up, muscles screaming.",
		"has-ladder": "I set my ladder down against the balcony and easily climb over the rail. An empty room awaits me inside the mansion. I find my way to the altar...",
		"need-key": "The ornate lock stares back. No picking this—I'll need to find another way in.",
		"knife": "I knock, flashing the ritual blade. 'Lost my robe,' I lie. The cultists exchange glances before bowing me inside.",
		"has-robe": "The crimson robe earns me deep bows. They murmur titles—'High Priest'—as I stride past. The charade works better than expected.",
		"mansion2": "Funeral spices clot the air. Staircases multiply like spider legs. Each step crumbles at the edges. The whispers aren't coming from the walls—they're coming from between them.",
		"rotunda": "The dome fractures moonlight into living shapes. The seal on the floor pulses—not with light but pressure, its golden runes squirming when I blink. Blood shouldn't smell this sweet. The voices aren't echoes—they're in my jawbone.",
		"altar": "Names crawl across the altar's surface, each groove dark and damp. Mine sits half-finished. Touching the carvings leaves my fingers stinking of brine and burnt hair.",
		"skylight": "The stained glass warps the moon into a cataract eye. Below, the seal's runes aren't reflecting light—they're drinking it, pulsing in time with the distant tide.",
		"leave": "The door shuts with a groan. Wind carries something like my daughter's voice—or just vines scraping stone. The mansion's windows pulse twice as I walk away. Like a heartbeat. Like counting down."

		"ceiling-fan": "The fan’s blades carve slow circles into the air, a little louder than it should be. Click. Whir. Click. Like a metronome.\n\nI’m reminded of my daughter’s favorite track — Victim, from that Dead Inside album she played too loud. 'Swinging dead in summer wind…' She’d mouth the words while braiding her hair, grinning like it was just some dumb lyric. But now the fan’s rhythm syncs with it. Click. Swinging. Whir. Dead.\n\n'My parents will go crazy, slowly…'\nI should get up. But the couch holds me like a hand.\n[SANITY REDUCED]",
		"vines": "Just vines. Normal. Overgrown. Thin, fibrous tendrils creep down from the windowframe, curling like lazy fingers. They don’t move when I look at them. But when I turn away, in the corner of my vision, they twitch.\n\nI reach up. The moment before my fingers touch one, the vine tightens. A shudder runs through the whole mass, like a muscle flexing.\n\nOutside, the wind blows, and the vines go still. But now I can’t stop looking.\nEvery time I glance, they’ve gotten just a little closer to the floor.\n[SANITY REDUCED]",
		"birds": "The birds hover in the wind. The ones on the sand tilt their heads in unison, black eyes locking onto me.\n\nThen there’s the close one—close enough to touch. Its beak opens. Not a screech. A whisper.\n“She’s right where you left her.”\n\nI reach out. My fingers graze feathers. The gull collapses into a tangle of evaporating seaweed. The others take flight, their wings beating in unison.\n\nClick. Whir. Click.\nJust like the ceiling fan at home.\n[SANITY REDUCED]",
		"ocean": "The waves don’t crash—they breathe. In. Out. Like the tide is a great, snoozing beast beneath the sand. The water isn’t blue anymore. It’s the color of a fading bruise. Purple. Yellow at the edges.\n\nI count the waves. Their rhythm sings a song. Their shape seems square and digital. The ocean is holding its breath.\n\nAnd then—a sound. Not a gull, not the wind. A voice, half-drowned, calling from the water on the horizon.\n\n“You’re already too late.”\n[SANITY REDUCED]",
		"tracks": "The rails seem to hum even when no train is coming. A low, metallic vibration, like the tracks are singing to themselves. A tune without a melody. A warning without words.\n\nThe timetable board flickers—departure times melting into gibberish, then into symbols I almost recognize.\nA shadow moves in the nearby train tunnel. Not a train. Something longer. Something that sways.\n\nThe rails go silent. The shadow is gone. But the taste of copper lingers on my tongue.\n[SANITY REDUCED]",
		"ceiling": "The ceiling isn’t gone.\nIt’s just... farther now.\n\nI crane my neck, expecting rafters, cobwebs, the underside of the roof—but there’s nothing. No. Not nothing. Worse.\n\nThe darkness pulses.\nLike a throat swallowing.\nLike something up there is breathing.\n\nA drop of cold water lands on my cheek. I wipe it away. My fingers come back red.\n[SANITY REDUCED]",
		"blood": "The blood isn’t dry. It squirms. Thin, glossy tendrils spider outward from the edges of each splash, creeping like liquid veins. The thicker pools ripple, as if stirred by an invisible finger.\n\nI crouch, reaching—and the blood flinches away from me. It doesn't seem red anymore. It’s the same purple-black as the inside of my eyelids when I wake gasping at 3 AM.\n\nI straighten up. The blood goes still. Now it’s just red blood again.\n\nProbably.\n[SANITY REDUCED]",
		"magic": "The circle isn’t just glowing—it’s breathing.\n\nThe violet light pulses in time with some distant, depthless heartbeat. The symbols twist if I stare too long, their edges writhing like worms in wet soil.\n\nI step closer. The light doesn’t cast shadows—it eats them, leaving only stark, fever-bright outlines. One rune flickers.\n\nThe light hums. It’s not a sound. It’s the vibration of a throat before it screams.\n[SANITY REDUCED]"

The horror is that I clawed my way back anyway.\n\nThe attic hatch still yawns above me. The abduction letter still whispers. Sanity is the cruelest prison. I close my eyes. Let the tide pull me under again.",
