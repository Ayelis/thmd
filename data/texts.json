	"events": {
		"home1": "The alarm clock's silence is the first thing that feels wrong. The house is too still—no breakfast sounds, no cartoons, no laughter. Just the groan of the water heater and the hum of the fridge.\n\n'Hey, kiddo?'\n\nNo answer. Her door hangs open, revealing a made bed and an untouched backpack. My phone shows no messages. The air feels thick with waiting.",
		"home2": "The lock resists before yielding. Inside, the air tastes stale with absence. Her room remains frozen—the same made bed, the same uneaten lunch. I almost believe she's just forgotten to text. Almost. The house disagrees, its silence screaming what I won't admit: she's been gone longer than I think.",
		"dresser": "The drawer creaks open. My transit pass winks up at me. 'Well, at least you didn't vanish,' I mutter, pocketing the little plastic lifeline.",
		"get-letter": "Beneath unpaid bills, the wax-sealed letter waits. Torn edges. Words cut from magazines: 'WE HAVE YOUR DAUGHTER. SHE WAS CHOSEN. FOLLOW THE TIDE.' The glue reeks of saltwater and something faintly metallic.",
		"hall": "The closet yields a collapsible metal detector—odd, but potentially useful. I stash it in my bag, wondering who bought this and why.",
		"hatch": "A square of wood in the ceiling—how'd I forget the attic? The pull-down ladder's been broken since childhood. Getting up there won't be easy.",
		"street": "Streetlights flicker like dying thoughts. A shadow by the telephone pole stands too tall, too still. The security cam would probably show only static. I should check the feed... if I can get online.",
		"attic": "Damp wood and something metallic—copper or dried glue? A dresser slouches in the corner, its surface littered with useless trinkets and a single photograph placed face-down.",
		"get-robe": "The drawer reveals a blood-red robe with gold trim, nestled between mothballs. Why did Grandpa own this ceremonial-looking thing? The fabric smells of camphor and something earthier, but it might prove useful.",
		"windowgaze": "The window's grime distorts the world like a funhouse mirror. Vines slither through cracks, their stems unnaturally thick and glistening like oil-slicked flesh.",
		"get-rope": "Rope coils in heaps—some strands knotted into crude symbols. A few twitch when the wind rattles the pane. I gather them quickly, my skin prickling as the knots brush my palms.",
		"transit1": "The turnstile light blares red. My pass is still on the kitchen counter. A train whips past, its wind tugging at my hair. The clerk eyes me through smudged glass. 'Last train leaves at sunset,' he says. 'You don't wanna miss it.'",
		"transit2": "The turnstile clicks open like a tongue. The station hums with bored commuters. A child's laugh crackles into static over the speakers. 'Next train: Beach Line. Last departure today.' The clerk nods—like he's seen this play out before.",
		"library": "The air stinks of ozone and rotting paper. The librarian's fingers tap like a metronome. 'Card?' she drones. When I shake my head, she slides a form across the desk. 'Terminal three. One hour.' Her tone suggests books aren't why people come here anymore.",
		"library2": "The monitor glows sickly. Social media? Blocked. News? Blocked. But local archives load: police blotters, tide charts, notices about missing pets near the shore. The clock above the terminal ticks louder than it should.",
		"left-library": "Fluorescents buzz like dying flies as I step outside. Across the square, a gargoyle on the library's facade watches me a beat too long. Its stone eyes seem to track my movement.",
		"stacks": "Dusty tomes reveal the truth—the '86 'chemical spill' was a cover-up. A faded photo shows the sheriff padlocking that blue shack. Scribbled in the margin: '16-2-18, high tide on the solstice.' The numbers itch at my brain.",
		"police": "The receptionist's nails click against her keyboard. 'Missing persons? Fill out a form. Detective's booked till Thursday.' She smirks without looking up. 'Unless it's an emergency?' My hesitation answers for me. 'Thought so.'",
		"police2": "The detective's desk is a graveyard of files. His left hand bears the ghost of a wedding ring—pale skin where gold recently rested. A photo slips from a folder: a dark-haired woman, smiling. Him, before. He snatches it back before I can look too close.",
		"papers": "Rifling through paperwork, my fingers brush cold metal—a key marked 'Evidence' hidden beneath incident reports. The teeth look oddly ceremonial.",
		"police-drawer": "A quick glance at the door. The drawer squeaks as I extract a small megaphone. Not standard issue, but potentially useful. Into the backpack it goes.",
		"police-computer": "The password screen shows his wallpaper—the detective and a woman holding up their wedding rings. He's actually smiling in the photo. The date in the corner is from three weeks ago.",
		"evidence": "A red vinyl chair screams against the drab walls. Case labels whisper: 'Missing. Arson. Cult Activity?' Box #17 rustles faintly—like fingernails on cardboard. I step back.",
		"paperwork": "Blueprints reveal a network of tunnels beneath the hilltop mansion. The annotations suggest easy access if I approach from the north side. Someone drew a red circle around the property.",
		"drawers": "The revolver's grip sticks—sweat or old blood? Six chambers. One empty. The others click when tilted, as if something inside shifts restlessly. The serial number's been filed away.",
		"window": "Through wire-reinforced glass, the precinct buzzes with muted activity. A file on the detective's desk catches my eye: 'TIDE INCIDENT – EYES ONLY'. The plant beside it rustles though there's no draft.",
		"beach": "The shack shouldn't still be standing. Its blue planks look freshly painted despite decades of salt wind. The padlock gleams like new. A weathered notice flaps: 'NO TRESPASSING BY ORDER OF THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE'—the rest scribbled into illegibility.",
		"dagger": "The metal detector shrieks. Buried in wet sand: a ritual knife with a serrated edge. I nearly slice my finger digging it up. The blade smells like low tide.",
		"sand": "Hot grit slips through my fingers. Each handful feels heavier than it should. There's probably nothing here. Probably.",
		"sky": "The clouds hang like damp gauze—translucent and stubborn. They don’t move so much as peel, slow and grudging, as if the sky can’t decide whether to heal or scar. The sun bleeds through in patches, hot and uneven, like a fever pressing against glass.",
		"shack": "The blue shack from the articles. My only real lead. The padlock stares back, daring me to try its combination.",
		"door": "Heavy-duty combination lock. The dials turn stiffly but aren't frozen. Someone's been here recently enough to keep it from rusting shut.",
		"dog": "A massive dog blocks the path—muscle and matted fur. Its growl vibrates in my chest. Every childhood fear of dark basements and bad dogs surges up. Run. Now.",
		"pet-dog": "Good doggo! The beast's tail wags as I scratch behind its ears. A wet tongue drags across my wrist. [Sanity Restored!]",
		"shack1": "The door groans open. The smell hits first—mildew undercut by incense and wet stone. The walls stretch backward farther than possible. The ceiling vanishes into shadow. This stopped being a shack the moment I crossed the threshold.",
		"shack2": "Tide charts paper the walls, their symbols itching at my eyes. The floorboards warp unnaturally into stone. The air hums—not with wind, but voices. Chanting. Or maybe that's just the blood roaring in my ears.",
		"get-pail": "A galvanized metal pail lurks in the corner, sturdy enough to hold... something. No idea what yet, but into the backpack it goes.",
		"shack-desk": "The drawer reveals a map—recruitment targets circled in red ink. The hilltop mansion dominates the center. Recent coffee stains suggest this is still an active plan.",
		"shack-drawers": "Rope loops tangle in the drawer. Not a single length but dozens of pre-made nooses. They stack neatly despite their grim purpose.",
		"mansion1": "A robed figure materializes from the shadows, pressing a flyer into my palm. His fingers stretch too long, nails ridged with old blood. 'The Tide doesn't need you yet,' he rasps. Behind him, the mansion's windows pulse—not with light, but with movement.",
		"cultist": "The robed figure looms closer. My skin crawls with the certainty that his hood shadows no human face. Time to go.",
		"balcony": "The balcony hangs just beyond reach. No matter how I jump, my fingers scrape empty air.",
		"tunnels": "Hours of stumbling through lightless passages. My hands brush damp stone until finally—a door. The wood thrums under my touch.",
		"has-rope": "The rope snakes around the balcony post. One tug to test it, then I haul myself up, muscles screaming.",
		"need-key": "The ornate lock stares back. No picking this—I'll need to find another way in.",
		"knife": "I knock, flashing the ritual blade. 'Lost my robe,' I lie. The cultists exchange glances before bowing me inside.",
		"has-robe": "The crimson robe earns me deep bows. They murmur titles—'High Priest'—as I stride past. The charade works better than expected.",
		"mansion2": "Funeral spices clot the air. Staircases multiply like spider legs. Each step crumbles at the edges. The whispers aren't coming from the walls—they're coming from between them.",
		"rotunda": "The dome fractures moonlight into living shapes. The seal on the floor pulses—not with light but pressure, its golden runes squirming when I blink. Blood shouldn't smell this sweet. The voices aren't echoes—they're in my jawbone.",
		"altar": "Names crawl across the altar's surface, each groove dark and damp. Mine sits half-finished. Touching the carvings leaves my fingers stinking of brine and burnt hair.",
		"skylight": "The stained glass warps the moon into a cataract eye. Below, the seal's runes aren't reflecting light—they're drinking it, pulsing in time with the distant tide.",
		"leave": "The door shuts with a groan. Wind carries something like my daughter's voice—or just vines scraping stone. The mansion's windows pulse twice as I walk away. Like a heartbeat. Like counting down."

	"insanity": {
		"ceiling-fan": "The fan’s blades carve slow circles into the air, each rotation a little louder than it should be. Click. Whir. Click. Like a metronome counting down to nothing.\n\nI’m reminded of my daughter’s favorite track — Victim, from that Dead Inside album she played too loud. 'Swinging dead in summer wind…' She’d mouth the words while braiding her hair, grinning like it was just some dumb lyric. But now the fan’s rhythm syncs with it. Click. Swinging. Whir. Dead.\n\nThe shadows between the blades stretch longer each pass. For a second, I see shapes—not dust, but strands, like hair tangled in the mechanism. The fan stutters. A high, thin noise rises under the motor’s grind. A giggle? A whimper? The screws holding it to the ceiling are crusted with something dark. Rust. Or dried glue. Or—\n\nI blink. The fan’s clean again. Click. Whir.\nThe track’s still in my head. 'My parents will go crazy, slowly…'\nI should get up. But the couch holds me like a hand.\n[SANITY REDUCED]",
		"vines": "At first, they’re just vines. Normal. Overgrown. The kind of thing I keep meaning to trim but never do. Thin, fibrous tendrils creep along the ceiling, curling like lazy fingers. They don’t move when I look at them. But when I turn away, in the corner of my vision, they twitch.\n\nI reach up. The moment before my fingers touch one, the vine tightens. A shudder runs through the whole mass, like a muscle flexing.\n\nOutside, the wind blows.\nThe vines go still.\nBut now I can’t stop seeing them.\nEvery time I walk past the window, they’ve gotten just a little closer to the floor.\n[SANITY REDUCED]",
		"birds": "The birds in the air hang too still, wings frozen mid-beat, as if the sky’s a pinned photograph. The ones on the sand tilt their heads in unison, black eyes locking onto me.\n\nThen there’s the close one—close enough to touch. Its beak parts. Not a screech. A whisper.\n\n'She’s right where you left her.'\n\nI reach out. My fingers graze feathers—cold and stiff, like wet paper. The gull collapses into a tangle of string and seaweed. The others take flight, finally moving, their wings beating in perfect time.\n\nClick. Whir. Click.\nJust like the ceiling fan at home.\n[SANITY REDUCED]",
		"ocean": "The waves don’t crash—they breathe. In. Out. Like the tide is some great, slumbering beast beneath the sand. The water isn’t blue. Not really. It’s the color of a fading bruise. Purple. Yellow at the edges.\n\nA shape floats just beneath the surface. Too big to be a fish. Too still to be driftwood. It doesn’t move with the waves. It watches.\n\nI count the seconds between the waves. Ten. Twenty. Thirty. The rhythm is wrong. The pauses stretch too long. The ocean is holding its breath.\n\nAnd then—a sound. Not a gull, not the wind. A voice, half-drowned, calling from where the water meets the horizon.\n'You’re already too late.'\n[SANITY REDUCED]",
		"tracks": "The rails hum even when no train is coming. A low, metallic vibration, like the tracks are singing to themselves. A tune without a melody. A warning without words.\n\nI press my palm to the steel. It’s warm. Too warm. As if something heavy and hungry just passed through, seconds ago, unseen.\n\nThe air smells like ozone and burnt sugar. The timetable board flickers—departure times melting into gibberish, then into symbols I almost recognize.\nA shadow moves in the nearby train tunnel. Not a train. Something longer.\n\nSomething that sways. The rails go silent.\nThe shadow is gone.\nBut the taste of copper lingers on my tongue.\n[SANITY REDUCED]",
		"ceiling": "The ceiling isn’t gone.\nIt’s just… farther now.\n\nA black so deep it drinks the light from my flashlight beam, swallowing it whole without a glimmer in return. I crane my neck, expecting rafters, cobwebs, the underside of the roof—but there’s nothing. No. Not nothing. Worse.\n\nThe darkness pulses.\nLike a throat swallowing.\nLike something up there is breathing.\n\nA drop of cold water lands on my cheek. I wipe it away. My fingers come back red.\n[SANITY REDUCED]",
		"blood": "The blood isn’t dry.\n\nIt squirms.\n\nThin, glossy tendrils spider outward from the edges of each splash, creeping like liquid veins across the concrete. The thicker pools ripple, as if stirred by an invisible finger. I crouch, reaching—\n\n—and the blood flinches away from my shadow.\n\nIt’s not red anymore.\n\nIt’s the same purple-black as the altar’s seal. The same purple-black as the sky in the shack’s impossible ceiling. The same purple-black as the inside of my eyelids when I wake gasping at 3 AM.\n\nI straighten up.\n\nThe blood goes still.\n\nNow it’s just red blood again.\n\nProbably.\n[SANITY REDUCED]",
		"magic": "The circle isn’t just glowing—it’s breathing.\n\nEach carved line pulses like a vein, the violet light throbbing in time with some distant, depthless heartbeat. The symbols twist if you stare too long, their edges writhing like worms in wet soil.\n\nYou step closer. The air tastes of ozone and rotting honey. The light doesn’t cast shadows—it eats them, leaving only stark, fever-bright outlines: your daughter’s silhouette, the cultists’ hollow-eyed masks, the altar’s jagged teeth.\n\nOne rune flickers. For a second, it’s not a symbol at all. It’s a word.\n\nYOURS.\n\nThen it’s just a rune again.\n\nThe light hums. It’s not a sound. It’s the vibration of a throat before it screams.\n[SANITY REDUCED]"

		"sanity": "Reality fractures into static—a television left screaming in an empty room. I blink up at a fluorescent sun, its sterile light peeling back the delusion: no missing daughter, no tide cult, just these four stained walls. The horror isn’t that it wasn’t real. The horror is that I clawed my way back anyway. The shack’s salt-stained door still whispers. The attic hatch yawns above me. Sanity is the cruelest prison. I close my eyes. Let the tide pull me under again.",
		"100": "I linger in shadows, trading loyalty for time. She is extracted with surgical precision. The others remain unaware until long after I’m gone.",
		"101": "I’m the whisper in the wires. The building catches fire from within. She meets me at the rendezvous, wrapped in smoke and silence.",
		"102": "They call it an inside job. I leave no fingerprints. She thinks I’m a hero. I don’t correct her.",
		"110": "I offer no allegiance, only calculated mercy. She is my only anchor. The cult is wounded but not destroyed.",
		"111": "They ask what side I were on. I answer with a name: hers. In the end, that’s all that mattered.",
		"112": "Her footsteps echo behind me. I didn’t stop them, not really. But I did enough. I hope that’s true.",
		"120": "I stand in the spotlight, ash coating my shoulders. She walks beside me, stunned but alive. The reporters ask who I am. I lie.",
		"121": "I turned the world’s attention on them. The cult breaks, screaming. She clings to me as the cameras flash.",
		"122": "The flood begins with a smile. Mine. Her hand slips into mine like it was always meant to. The crowd parts for us both.",
		"200": "I silence the guards and whisper old rites. The ritual proceeds. She walks willingly—eyes glazed, heart emptied.",
		"201": "I hide in plain sight, rising through their ranks. The ritual goes smoothly. She thanks me. I nod.",
		"202": "I bow with the others as the tide swallows the moon. She is reborn in salt and shadow. I accept the crown.",
		"210": "The doctrine is mine now. I rewrite it to include her. The others chant. She just watches me.",
