			"name": "Transit Pass",
			"description": "The plastic is warm, as if recently held by someone else. The expiration date is smudged—either by rain or something stickier."
		},
		"LIBCARD": {
			"name": "Library Card",
			"description": "The edges are frayed, like it’s been chewed on. The librarian’s stamped approval is faded, except for the word ‘RENEWED’ in unnervingly fresh ink."

			"name": "Letter",

		"DAGGER": {
			"name": "Ritual Dagger",
			"description": "The blade is etched with symbols that shift under direct light. The hilt is wrapped in hair—too coarse to be your daughter’s."
		},
		"ROBE": {
			"name": "Fancy Robes",
			"description": "The fabric is heavier than it should be, like it’s woven with something besides thread. The gold embroidery glints like knife-edges in the dark, forming patterns that hurt to focus on. This robe seems fit for a king—or a sacrifice."
		},
		"ROPE": {
			"name": "Length of Rope",
			"description": "The fibers are stained in uneven patches. It smells of salt and wet earth, though it hasn't left the attic in years."
		},
		"PAIL": {
			"name": "Metal Pail",
			"description": "The metal is pocked with rust, except for the handle, which is polished smooth from use. The bottom is caked in a dried, flaking residue."

		},
		"KEY": {
			"name": "Steel Key",
			"description": "It’s cold, even in your pocket. The teeth are jagged, like they were filed to fit a lock that shouldn’t exist."
		},
		"FLYER": {
			"name": "Recruitment Flyer",
			"description": "The paper crackles in your hand. An open eye gazes from a circle of waves, printed in deep navy. Beneath it, bold words: 'The Tide is rising. Be cleansed. Be claimed.' No contact info. Just coordinates."
		},
		"DETECTOR": {
			"name": "Metal Detector",
			"description": "The needle twitches even when the device is off. The casing is cracked, revealing wires that pulse faintly, like veins."

		"letter": "Somehow, it was beneath a stack of unpaid bills... The paper is torn at the edges, as if ripped from a larger page. The letters are cut from magazines, glued in jagged lines:\n\n'WE HAVE YOUR DAUGHTER. SHE WAS CHOSEN FOR THIS FATE. GO FOLLOW THE TIDE.'\n\nThe glue smells faintly of saltwater.",
		"police": "The receptionist doesn’t look up from her computer. 'Missing persons? Fill out a form. Detective’s booked out till Thursday.' Her nails tap against the keys. 'Unless it’s an emergency?'\n\nI hesitate. She smirks. 'Thought so.'"
		"library": "Spent the afternoon buried in the library's local history section—dusty tomes, microfiche that smelled like burnt toast, obituaries with more secrets than the dead deserved. Turns out the 'chemical spill' that closed the north beach in '86 was a cover-up. The caption called it a 'public hazard' and a faded news photo showed the sheriff padlocking that blue shack north of the pier. Funny how the hazard's still there, decades later, just waiting for someone to turn those rusted dials. Scrawled on the margin of the article in faded pencil marks is a message. '6-2-9, high tide on the solstice'."
	},
	"rooms": {
		"HOME": {
			"name": "My Home",
			"description1": "The alarm never went off. That’s the first thing that feels wrong. The second is the silence—no clatter of cereal bowls, no cartoon theme songs bleeding through the walls, no giggles echoing down the hall. Just the groan of the water heater, the creak of the house settling, the distant hum of the fridge. I roll out of bed, throat tight.\n\n'Hey, kiddo?'\n\nNo answer. The hallway yawns empty. Her door is cracked open—no tangled sheets, no scattered toys. Just a neatly made bed and a backpack slumped by the desk, lunch still packed inside. Uneaten. I check my phone. No messages. No missed calls. The house holds its breath.",
			"description2": "The key sticks in the lock like it’s resisting me. Inside, the air is thick—not with dust, but with absence. I call out anyway, half-expecting (hoping for) a shout of 'Dad!'—but the silence swallows it whole.\n\nHer room is unchanged. The bed is still made. The backpack still sits where I left it. The uneaten lunch mocks me from inside. I tell myself she’s at a friend’s, that she forgot to text. I almost believe it. But the house knows better. The walls hum with it: She’s gone. She’s been gone. The only question left is why."
		},
		"ATTIC": {
			"name": "Musty Attic",
			"description1": "The air smells of damp wood and something sharper—like old copper or dried glue. The lone window is a cataract of grime, its glass warped into liquid shapes by time. Vines of gangrenous green slither through cracks in the windowframe, their stems too thick, too waxy, as if dipped in oil.\n\nThe dresser’s top is covered in an array of useless items, and a single photograph, face-down.\n\nRope lies in heaps. No—not just rope. Some strands are knotted into crude symbols, their frayed ends bristling like insect legs. A few seem to twitch when the wind outside rattles the window."
		},
		"TRANSIT": {
			"name": "Lightrail Stop",
			"description1": "The station tiles stick to my shoes like wet skin. I pat my pockets—nothing but lint and a receipt. The turnstile light blinks red. Shit. The pass is on the kitchen counter, right where I left it.\n\nA train rumbles past, air whipping my hair. The clerk eyes me through smudged glass. 'No pass, no ride.' Behind him, the clock's minute hand clunks heavily into the future. 'Last train leaves at sunset,' he says. 'You don’t wanna miss it.'",
			"description2": "The pass is warm in my hand, edges frayed from use. I swipe it. The turnstile clicks open like a tongue. The lightrail station buzzes with the monotony of people going nowhere important. Timetables flicker. A child’s laughter from the loudspeakers cuts to static.\n\nThe platform smells like ozone and stale pretzels. A voice crackles overhead: 'Next train: Beach Line. Last departure of the day.' The clerk nods at me—too familiar, like he’s seen this story before."
		},
		"LIBRARY": {
			"name": "City Library",
			"description1": "The librarian scans my card with a practiced smile. 'Terminal three. One hour.'\n\nThe monitor glows like an aquarium. Social media? Blocked. News sites? Blocked. But the local archives load, slow and syrupy. Police blotters. Tide charts. A 'Community Notice' about missing pets near the shore. My fingers hover over the keys. The clock ticks."
		},
		"POLICE": {
			"name": "Police Station",
			"description1": "The receptionist’s stare lingers a second too long. 'He’ll see you now.'\n\nThe room smells like burnt coffee and regret. The detective’s desk is a graveyard of paperwork: incident reports stacked like unmarked headstones, a printer wheezing out fresh ink, spitting out yet another document. At the top, in bold: 'CASE #4289 – UNSOLVED.' His computer screen casts a jaundiced glow on his face. He doesn’t offer me a seat.\n\nThe detective’s hands are rough—knuckles scarred, nails bitten raw. But it’s the pale band of skin on his left ring finger that catches my eye. A deep mark, like the ghost of a wedding ring recently gone.\n\nHe notices me staring. His jaw tightens as he flips open a case file. A photo slips out—a woman with dark hair, smiling. Her. Before the ink is even dry on the missing person’s report, he snatches it back."
		},
		"EVIDENCE": {
			"name": "Evidence Lockup",
			"description1": "The red chair screams against the drab. It’s the only color here, vinyl on the back split like a wound.\n\nCase files crowd the shelves, their labels half-scratched off. Missing. Arson. Cult Activity? A drawer juts out of one shelf, crammed with sealed evidence bags. One’s torn open. Empty.\n\nThe slatted window cuts the light into bars, painting the floor with prison stripes. Something rustles in Box #17. A sound like fingernails on cardboard."
		},
		"BEACH": {
			"name": "Private Beach",
			"description1": "The sand drinks my footsteps. Waves drag themselves ashore like something wounded. Further down the shore, a listing wooden shack with a red door seems to lean against the dunes.\n\nThe wind carries the tang of salt and something older—rotting kelp, maybe, or the iron bite of wet rust. The shack shouldn’t still be standing. Its blue planks are blistered with peeling paint, the thatched roof sagging like a tired mouth. A padlock glints on the door, stubborn as a tumor.\n\nA notice flaps weakly on a nail:\n\n~~NO TRESPASSING~~\n~~BY ORDER OF THE~~\n~~SHERIFF’S OFFICE~~\n\nThe rest is scribbled into oblivion. The combination lock’s dials are stiff, but not frozen. Someone’s been here. Recently."
		},
		"SHACK": {
			"name": "Abandoned Shack",
			"description1": "The door groans open—and the smell hits first. Mildew, yes, but underneath it: incense and wet stone. The air changes. The walls yawn outward, farther than they should. The ceiling isn’t there anymore, just a gullet of shadows stretching upward into vaulted darkness. This doesn’t feel like a shack anymore...",
			"description2": "The shack’s walls are papered with tide charts and symbols that itch at my eyes. The floorboards, warped and salt-swollen, fade into the dark, wood becoming stone. The air hums. Not with wind. With voices. Faint. Chanting. Or maybe it’s just the blood in my ears."
		},
		"MANSION": {
			"name": "Mansion Path",
			"description1": "A figure steps from the shadows, his ragged robe the color of a fresh bruise. He says nothing. Just presses the flyer into your palm. His fingers are too long, the nails ridged with old blood. The paper thrums against your skin, as if something inside it breathes.\n\n'Turn back,' he murmurs. His voice is blunt, like a shovel hitting dirt. 'The Tide doesn’t need you yet.' Behind him, the mansion’s windows pulse. Not with light. With movement.",
			"description2": "The air clots with the scent of wet charcoal and clove—funeral spices. The path crumbles underfoot. The mansion looms—its balconies sag like broken ribs, the ivy strangling its walls a too-vivid green.\n\nThe staircases multiply. Left? Right? Each landing offers another door, another shadow. Each step spilling gravel into the abyss below. The air thickens. It’s not wind in the trees. It’s whispering."
		},
		"ROTUNDA": {
			"name": "Rotunda Altar",
			"description1": "My breath fogs in the torchlight. Hallways twist back on themselves. Portraits watch with blackened eyes. Somewhere ahead, a low chant throbs against the walls. I press forward. The altar room waits.\n\nThe dome above is a cataract of lightly stained glass, fracturing the moonlight into something alive. The seal on the floor pulses—not in light, but in pressure, the golden symbols writhing if I look away.\n\nBlood isn’t supposed to smell sweet.\n\nThe voices aren’t echoes. They’re beneath me. In the walls. In my teeth. A syllable away from coalescing into a word I almost understand."
		}
	},
	"insanity": {
		"ceiling_fan": "The fan’s blades carve slow circles into the air, each rotation a little louder than it should be. Click. Whir. Click. Like a metronome counting down to nothing.\n\nI’m reminded of my daughter’s favorite track — Victim, from that Dead Inside album she played too loud. 'Swinging dead in summer wind…' She’d mouth the words while braiding her hair, grinning like it was just some dumb lyric. But now the fan’s rhythm syncs with it. Click. Swinging. Whir. Dead.\n\nThe shadows between the blades stretch longer each pass. For a second, I see shapes—not dust, but strands, like hair tangled in the mechanism. The fan stutters. A high, thin noise rises under the motor’s grind. A giggle? A whimper? The screws holding it to the ceiling are crusted with something dark. Rust. Or dried glue. Or—\n\nI blink. The fan’s clean again. Click. Whir.\nThe track’s still in my head. 'My parents will go crazy, slowly…'\nI should get up. But the couch holds me like a hand.",
		"vines": "At first, they’re just vines. Normal. Overgrown. The kind of thing you keep meaning to trim but never do. Thin, fibrous tendrils creep along the ceiling, curling like lazy fingers. They don’t move when you look at them. But when you turn away, in the corner of your vision, they twitch.\n\nYou reach up. The moment before your fingers touch one, the vine tightens. A shudder runs through the whole mass, like a muscle flexing.\n\nOutside, the wind blows.\nThe vines go still.\nBut now you can’t stop seeing them.\nEvery time you walk past the window, they’ve gotten just a little closer to the floor.",
		"birds": "The birds in the air hang too still, wings frozen mid-beat, as if the sky’s a pinned photograph. The ones on the sand tilt their heads in unison, black eyes locking onto me.\n\nThen there’s the close one—close enough to touch. Its beak parts. Not a screech. A whisper.\n\n'She’s right where you left her.'\n\nI reach out. My fingers graze feathers—cold and stiff, like wet paper. The gull collapses into a tangle of string and seaweed. The others take flight, finally moving, their wings beating in perfect time.\n\nClick. Whir. Click.\nJust like the ceiling fan at home.",
		"ocean": "The waves don’t crash—they breathe. In. Out. Like the tide is some great, slumbering beast beneath the sand. The water isn’t blue. Not really. It’s the color of a fading bruise. Purple. Yellow at the edges.\n\nA shape floats just beneath the surface. Too big to be a fish. Too still to be driftwood. It doesn’t move with the waves. It watches.\n\nI count the seconds between the waves. Ten. Twenty. Thirty. The rhythm is wrong. The pauses stretch too long. The ocean is holding its breath.\n\nAnd then—a sound. Not a gull, not the wind. A voice, half-drowned, calling from where the water meets the horizon.\n'You’re already too late.'",
		"tracks": "The rails hum even when no train is coming. A low, metallic vibration, like the tracks are singing to themselves. A tune without a melody. A warning without words.\n\nI press my palm to the steel. It’s warm. Too warm. As if something heavy and hungry just passed through, seconds ago, unseen.\n\nThe air smells like ozone and burnt sugar. The timetable board flickers—departure times melting into gibberish, then into symbols I almost recognize.\nA shadow moves in the tunnel. Not a train. Something longer. Something that sways.\n\nThe rails go silent.\nThe shadow is gone.\nBut the taste of copper lingers on my tongue.",
		"ceiling": "The ceiling isn’t gone.\nIt’s just… farther now.\n\nA black so deep it drinks the light from your flashlight beam, swallowing it whole without a glimmer in return. You crane your neck, expecting rafters, cobwebs, the underside of the roof—but there’s nothing. No. Not nothing. Worse.\n\nThe darkness pulses.\nLike a throat swallowing.\nLike something up there is breathing.\n\nA drop of cold water lands on your cheek. You wipe it away. Your fingers come back red.",
		"blood": "The blood isn’t dry.\n\nIt squirms.\n\nThin, glossy tendrils spider outward from the edges of each splash, creeping like liquid veins across the concrete. The thicker pools ripple, as if stirred by an invisible finger. You crouch, reaching—\n\n—and the blood flinches away from your shadow.\n\nIt’s not red anymore.\n\nIt’s the same purple-black as the altar’s seal. The same purple-black as the sky in the shack’s impossible ceiling. The same purple-black as the inside of your eyelids when you wake gasping at 3 AM.\n\nYou straighten up.\n\nThe blood goes still.\n\nNow it’s just red blood again.\n\nProbably."
