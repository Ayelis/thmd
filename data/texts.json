	"events": {
		"home1": "I wake up at home. The silence of the house is first thing that feels wrong. No breakfast sounds, no cartoons, no laughter. Just the groan of the water heater and the hum of the refrigerator.\n\n'Hey, kiddo?'\n\nNo answer. Her door sits open, revealing an already-made bed and an untouched backpack. The house is too still. No messages on my phone. The air feels thick with waiting.",
		"home2": "Inside my house, the air tastes stale with absence. Her room remains frozen—the same already-made bed, the same open backpack.\n\nI tell myself she's just forgotten to text. I almost believe it. Almost. The house disagrees, its silence screaming what I won't admit: she's been gone longer than I think.",
		"dresser": "Beneath unpaid bills, the wax-sealed letter waits. Torn edges. Words cut from magazines:\n\n'WE HAVE YOUR DAUGHTER.\nSHE WAS CHOSEN FOR THIS FATE.\nGO FOLLOW THE TIDE.'\n\nThe glue reeks of saltwater and something faintly metallic.\n\nOh, and my pass! The dresser drawer creaks open. My transit pass stares up at me.\n'At least you didn't vanish,' I mutter, pocketing the little plastic lifeline.",
		"hall": "The hall closet yields a collapsible metal detector... It's odd, but potentially useful. I stash it in my bag, wondering when or why I even bought this.",
		"hatch": "A square hatch of wood graces the ceiling. How'd I forget about the attic? The pull-down ladder's been broken since childhood. Getting up there won't be easy.",
		"street": "I peer out my front window. A shadow by the telephone pole stands too tall, too still. My DVR security camera system would probably show grainy evidence, if I could get online to check it... but I haven't had internet for months.",
		"attic": "I place down the stepladder and use it to boost myself to the attic hatch, pulling myself up and through. I'm not sure how long it's been since I've been in here. Forever ago.",
		"get-robe": "The drawer reveals a blood-red robe with gold trim, nestled between mothballs. Why did Grandpa own this ceremonial-looking thing? The fabric smells of camphor and something earthier, but it might prove useful.",
		"windowgaze": "The window's grime distorts the world like a funhouse mirror. Vines slither through cracks, their stems unnaturally thick and glistening like oil-slicked flesh.",
		"get-rope": "Rope coils in heaps—some strands knotted into crude symbols. A few twitch when the wind rattles the pane. I gather them quickly, my skin prickling as the knots brush my palms.",
		"nopass": "The turnstile light blares red. My transit pass is still at home in the dresser.",
		"transit2": "The turnstile clicks open like a tongue. The station hums with bored commuters. A child's laugh is drowned out by crackling static from the speakers. 'Next train: Beach Line. Last departure today.' The clerk nods—like he's seen this play out before.",
		"library": "The air stinks of ozone and rotting paper. The librarian's fingers tap like a metronome.\n\n'Card?' she drones, nasally.\n\nWhen I shake my head, she slides a signup form across the desk. A few minutes later, I have a new card in hand.\n\n'Terminal three. One hour.'\n\nHer tone suggests books aren't why people come here anymore.",
		"library2": "The monitor glows sickly. Social media? Blocked. News? Blocked. But local archives load: police blotters, tide charts, notices about missing pets near the shore. The clock above the terminal ticks louder than it should.",
		"left-library": "Fluorescents buzz weakly like dying flies as I step outside.\n\nAcross the square, a gargoyle on the library's facade watches me a beat too long. Its stone eyes seem to track my movement.",
		"stacks": "Looking through old microfiche newspapers isn't my idea of fun, but what else can I do? I scan quickly for headlines about disappearances in town.\n\nHere's one. Apparently the '86 chemical spill was a cover-up for cult activity, and hostages were rescued. A faded photo shows the sheriff padlocking that blue shack on the beach.\n\nSomehow scribbled in the margin: '16-2-18, high tide on the solstice.' The numbers itch at my brain.",
		"stacks2": "I go over what I've found. In old microfiche articles, there are headlines about local disappearances.\n\nIn '86, a cult called 'The Tide' was found responsible for numerous abductions. Faded photos relate the shack on the beach to this cult.\n\nThere are also numbers scrawled in the margins that seem important somehow: '16-2-18'.",
		"police": "The receptionist's nails click against her keyboard.\n\n'Missing persons? Fill out a form. Detective's booked till Thursday.'\n\nShe smirks without looking up.\n\n'Unless you have an appointment?'\n\nMy hesitation answers for me.\n\n'Thought so.'\n\nAll I know is I can't wait that long.",
		"police2": "The detective's desk is a graveyard of files.\n\nHis left hand bears the ghost of a wedding ring—pale skin where gold recently rested. A photo slips from a folder: a dark-haired woman, smiling. Standing with him. Well, him from before.\n\nHe snatches it back before I can look too close.",
		"police3": "The detective's desk is a graveyard of files.\n\nThe detective himself, gone. But I'm here by invite. I get myself a coffee.",
		"papers": "Rifling through paperwork, my fingers brush cold metal. A key marked 'Evidence' hidden beneath incident reports. The teeth look oddly ceremonial.",
		"police-computer": "The password screen shows his wallpaper—the detective and a woman holding up their wedding rings. He's actually smiling in the photo. The date in the corner is from three weeks ago.",
		"evidence": "A red vinyl chair stands out against the drab walls. Case labels whisper: 'Missing. Arson. Cult Activity?' Box #17 rustles faintly—like fingernails on cardboard. I step back.",
		"paperwork": "Blueprints reveal a network of tunnels beneath the hilltop mansion. The annotations suggest easy access if I approach from the north side. Someone drew a red circle around the property.",
		"drawers": "Maybe I shouldn't be digging through drawers, looting through evidence bags, but I don't know what might come in handy.\n\nThe revolver's grip sticks—sweat or old blood? Six chambers. One empty. The others click when tilted, as if something inside shifts restlessly. The serial number's been filed away.\n\nBetter to have it and not need it...",
		"window": "Through wire-reinforced glass, the precinct buzzes with muted activity. I notice the receptionist looking at me looking out, and close the shutters again.",
		"beach": "The shack shouldn't still be standing. Its blue planks look freshly painted despite decades of salt wind. The padlock gleams like new.\n\nA weathered notice flaps:\n'NO TRESPASSING BY ORDER OF THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE'\n\nThe rest is scribbled into illegibility.",
		"dagger": "The metal detector shrieks after I wave it around here a few times. Buried deep: a ritual knife with a serrated edge. I nearly slice my finger digging it up.",
		"sand": "Hot grit slips through my fingers. Each handful feels heavier than it should. There's probably nothing here. Probably.",
		"sky": "The clouds hang like damp gauze—translucent and stubborn. They don’t move so much as peel, slow and grudging, as if the sky can’t decide whether to heal or scar. The sun bleeds through in patches, hot and uneven, like a fever pressing against glass.",
		"shack": "The blue shack from the articles. My only real lead. The padlock stares back, daring me to try its combination.",
		"door": "Heavy-duty combination lock. The dials turn stiffly but aren't frozen. Someone's been here recently enough to keep it from rusting shut.",
		"dog": "A massive dog blocks the path—muscle and matted fur. Its growl vibrates in my chest. Every childhood fear of dark basements and bad dogs surges up. Run. Now.",
		"pet-dog": "Good doggo! The beast's tail wags as I scratch behind its ears. A wet tongue drags across my wrist.\n\n[Sanity Restored!]",
		"shack1": "I try the numbers I saw earlier, 16-2-18, and the lock resists a moment before yielding. The door groans on its rusty hinges. The smell hits first—mildew undercut by incense and wet stone. The walls stretch backward farther than possible. The ceiling vanishes into shadow. It feels different now, as if this stopped being a shack the moment I crossed the threshold.",
		"shack2": "Tide charts paper the walls, their symbols playing tricks on my eyes. The floorboards warp unnaturally into stone. The air hums—not with wind, but voices. Chanting. Or maybe that's just the blood roaring in my ears.",
		"get-ladder": "I pick up the old steel stepladder from the corner, and carry it with me. I hope we're not going far...",
		"shack-desk": "The drawer reveals a map—recruitment targets circled in red ink. The hilltop mansion dominates the center, while outward arrows seem to indicate this is a sort of headquarters.\n\nRecent coffee stains suggest this is still an active plan.",
		"shack-drawers": "Rope loops tangle in the drawer. Not a single length but dozens of pre-made hoops and nooses. They stack neatly despite their apparent grim purpose.",
		"shack-empty": "The drawers are mysteriously empty. Not counting the cobwebs...",
		"mansion": "A robed figure materializes from the shadows, pressing a flyer into my palm. His fingers stretch too long, his nails ridged with old blood. 'The Tide doesn't need you yet,' he rasps. Behind him, the mansion's windows pulse—not with light, but with movement.",
		"cultist": "The robed figure looms closer. My skin crawls with the certainty that his hood shadows no human face. Time to go.",
		"balcony": "The balcony hangs just beyond reach. No matter how I jump, my fingers scrape empty air.",
		"tunnels": "Hours of stumbling through lightless passages. My hands brush damp stone until finally—a door. The wood thrums under my touch.",
		"has-rope": "The rope snakes around the balcony post. One tug to test it, then I haul myself up, muscles screaming.",
		"need-key": "The ornate lock stares back. No picking this—I'll need to find another way in.",
		"knife": "I knock, flashing the ritual blade. 'Lost my robe,' I lie. The cultists exchange glances before bowing me inside.",
		"has-robe": "The crimson robe earns me deep bows. They murmur titles—'High Priest'—as I stride past. The charade works better than expected.",
		"mansion2": "Funeral spices clot the air. Staircases multiply like spider legs. Each step crumbles at the edges. The whispers aren't coming from the walls—they're coming from between them.",
		"rotunda": "The dome fractures moonlight into living shapes. The seal on the floor pulses—not with light but pressure, its golden runes squirming when I blink. Blood shouldn't smell this sweet. The voices aren't echoes—they're in my jawbone.",
		"altar": "Names crawl across the altar's surface, each groove dark and damp. Mine sits half-finished. Touching the carvings leaves my fingers stinking of brine and burnt hair.",
		"skylight": "The stained glass warps the moon into a cataract eye. Below, the seal's runes aren't reflecting light—they're drinking it, pulsing in time with the distant tide.",
		"leave": "The door shuts with a groan. Wind carries something like my daughter's voice—or just vines scraping stone. The mansion's windows pulse twice as I walk away. Like a heartbeat. Like counting down."

		"ceiling-fan": "The fan’s blades carve slow circles into the air, a little louder than it should be. Click. Whir. Click. Like a metronome.\n\nI’m reminded of my daughter’s favorite track — Victim, from that Dead Inside album she played too loud. 'Swinging dead in summer wind…' She’d mouth the words while braiding her hair, grinning like it was just some dumb lyric. But now the fan’s rhythm syncs with it. Click. Swinging. Whir. Dead.\n\n'My parents will go crazy, slowly…'\nI should get up. But the couch holds me like a hand.\n[SANITY REDUCED]",
		"vines": "Just vines. Normal. Overgrown. Thin, fibrous tendrils creep down from the windowframe, curling like lazy fingers. They don’t move when I look at them. But when I turn away, in the corner of my vision, they twitch.\n\nI reach up. The moment before my fingers touch one, the vine tightens. A shudder runs through the whole mass, like a muscle flexing.\n\nOutside, the wind blows, and the vines go still. But now I can’t stop looking.\nEvery time I glance, they’ve gotten just a little closer to the floor.\n[SANITY REDUCED]",
		"birds": "The birds hover in the wind. The ones on the sand tilt their heads in unison, black eyes locking onto me.\n\nThen there’s the close one—close enough to touch. Its beak opens. Not a screech. A whisper.\n\"She’s right where you left her.\"\n\nI reach out. My fingers graze feathers. The gull collapses into a tangle of evaporating seaweed. The others take flight, their wings beating in unison.\n\nClick. Whir. Click.\nJust like the ceiling fan at home.\n[SANITY REDUCED]",
		"ocean": "The waves don’t crash—they breathe. In. Out. Like the tide is a great, snoozing beast beneath the sand. The water isn’t blue anymore. It’s the color of a fading bruise. Purple. Yellow at the edges.\n\nI count the waves. Their rhythm sings a song. Their shape seems square and digital. The ocean is holding its breath.\n\nAnd then—a sound. Not a gull, not the wind. A voice, half-drowned, calling from the water on the horizon.\n\n\"You’re already too late.\"\n[SANITY REDUCED]",
		"tracks": "The rails seem to hum even when no train is coming. A low, metallic vibration, like the tracks are singing to themselves. A tune without a melody. A warning without words.\n\nThe timetable board flickers—departure times melting into gibberish, then into symbols I almost recognize.\nA shadow moves in the nearby train tunnel. Not a train. Something longer. Something that sways.\n\nThe rails go silent. The shadow is gone. But the taste of copper lingers on my tongue.\n[SANITY REDUCED]",
		"ceiling": "The ceiling isn’t gone.\nIt’s just... farther now.\n\nI crane my neck, expecting rafters, cobwebs, the underside of the roof—but there’s nothing. No. Not nothing. Worse.\n\nThe darkness pulses.\nLike a throat swallowing.\nLike something up there is breathing.\n\nA drop of cold water lands on my cheek. I wipe it away. My fingers come back red.\n[SANITY REDUCED]",
		"blood": "The blood isn’t dry. It squirms. Thin, glossy tendrils spider outward from the edges of each splash, creeping like liquid veins. The thicker pools ripple, as if stirred by an invisible finger.\n\nI crouch, reaching—and the blood flinches away from me. It doesn't seem red anymore. It’s the same purple-black as the inside of my eyelids when I wake gasping at 3 AM.\n\nI straighten up. The blood goes still. Now it’s just red blood again.\n\nProbably.\n[SANITY REDUCED]",
		"magic": "The circle isn’t just glowing—it’s breathing.\n\nThe violet light pulses in time with some distant, depthless heartbeat. The symbols twist if I stare too long, their edges writhing like worms in wet soil.\n\nI step closer. The light doesn’t cast shadows—it eats them, leaving only stark, fever-bright outlines. One rune flickers.\n\nThe light hums. It’s not a sound. It’s the vibration of a throat before it screams.\n[SANITY REDUCED]"

		"sanity": "Reality fractures into static—\na television left screaming in an empty room.\n\nI blink up at a fluorescent sun, its sterile light peeling back the delusion: no missing daughter, no tide cult, just these four stained walls.\nThe horror isn’t that it wasn’t real. The horror is that I clawed my way back anyway.\n\nThe attic hatch still yawns above me. The abduction letter still whispers. Sanity is the cruelest prison. I close my eyes. Let the tide pull me under again.",
		"left": "I walk away down the salt‑slick road—\na lone siren wailing in the distance.\n\nHer silhouette lingers in memory’s corner: \nrefusing my hand, choosing shadows over safety.\n\nThe ocean’s whisper follows me:\na promise broken, a heart left behind.\n\nSome doors never close; some echoes never fade.\n\nWhen the eternal nightmares descend, I am not among the first to be taken...",
		"sacrifice": "Darkness blooms behind her smile—\na crown of tide‑etched bone.\n\nShe steps through the cell bars,\npulling me into the cult’s embrace.\n\nMy final breath tastes of brine and regret.\n\nHer laughter drifts back to me,\ncalling me deeper into the endless tide.",
        "rescue": "We slip beyond the cult’s reach—\na pair of footprints side by side.\n\nHer hand in mine feels warm and real,\na promise kept beneath a rising moon.\n\nBehind us, the mansion lies silent.\n\nAhead, the night hums with fresh possibility.",
		"100": "I linger in shadows, trading loyalty for time. She is extracted with surgical precision. The others remain unaware until long after I’m gone.",
		"101": "I’m the whisper in the wires. The building catches fire from within. She meets me at the rendezvous, wrapped in smoke and silence.",
		"102": "They call it an inside job. I leave no fingerprints. She thinks I’m a hero. I don’t correct her.",
		"110": "I offer no allegiance, only calculated mercy. She is my only anchor. The cult is wounded but not destroyed.",
		"111": "They ask what side I were on. I answer with a name: hers. In the end, that’s all that mattered.",
		"112": "Her footsteps echo behind me. I didn’t stop them, not really. But I did enough. I hope that’s true.",
		"120": "I stand in the spotlight, ash coating my shoulders. She walks beside me, stunned but alive. The reporters ask who I am. I lie.",
		"121": "I turned the world’s attention on them. The cult breaks, screaming. She clings to me as the cameras flash.",
		"122": "The flood begins with a smile. Mine. Her hand slips into mine like it was always meant to. The crowd parts for us both.",
		"200": "I silence the guards and whisper old rites. The ritual proceeds. She walks willingly—eyes glazed, heart emptied.",
		"201": "I hide in plain sight, rising through their ranks. The ritual goes smoothly. She thanks me. I nod.",
		"202": "I bow with the others as the tide swallows the moon. She is reborn in salt and shadow. I accept the crown.",
		"210": "The doctrine is mine now. I rewrite it to include her. The others chant. She just watches me.",
		"211": "I stand above the altar, preaching futures no one wants. The crowd applauds. She weeps, unseen.",
		"212": "I offer her to The Tide. The storm begins. The crowd chants my name as the world begins to tremble.",
		"220": "The sky splits. The water answers. We are both quickly consumed—and satisfied.",
		"221": "She laughs beside me, radiant and awful. Together, we welcome the end.",
		"222": "The old gods rise, and she rises with them. I kneel. It is done.",
		"000": "I vanish beneath the fog, unheard and unseen. Her small hand grips mine tightly. The Tide never even knew I was there.",
		"001": "I ghost through the facility, rescuing her while the ritual crumbles behind me. No one believes what I saw. I disappear before anyone can ask.",
		"002": "The sirens never sound. The cult falls, but so does something inside me. I walk out with her, white-eyed and trembling, the salt still clinging to her skin.",
		"010": "I bend with the current but never break. She survives. We are both changed, but the world stays dry—for now.",
		"011": "Through whispered warnings and double lives, I lead her out. The cult fractures in my wake. I fade back into the city like a rumor.",
		"012": "Cameras catch my face. News anchors say my name. But she’s safe, and that’s enough. The rest is noise.",
		"020": "I speak their language, then rewrite it. The cult thinks I'm one of their own—until it’s too late. I walk free, carrying only her.",
		"021": "I shout above the waves, revealing everything. The building collapses. In the dust and panic, only I walk out with the girl.",
		"022": "The sky opens, and the ritual completes. She is returned to me—not rescued, but transformed. I embrace her anyway. She smiles with too many teeth."
